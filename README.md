# 🏛️ Cultural Heritage Explorer

This is my nationwide hackathon-winning project at **HACKQUEST**, called **Cultural Heritage Explorer**. It is a web-based system that detects Indian monuments using a **custom CNN model** and provides informative answers through a **Gradio ChatInterface** powered by the **OpenAI API**. The dataset was entirely self-curated during my internship at **IIT Hyderabad**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- 🖼️ Image classification of **24 famous Indian monuments** using a customized CNN model.
- 💬 Integration with **OpenAI API** to provide historical and cultural information through a chatbot.
- 🧠 Built using **Flask**, **Gradio**, and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.
- 📊 Dataset is custom-built using images collected from the web.
